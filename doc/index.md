# Getting started

## Overview
[ClickCorp](https://www.clickcorp.com) builds a new generation automation framework **Clicknium** to support GUI automation for all types of applications. Automation development efficiency is highly improved with features of Clicknium, including developer tooling support and cloud native data management for colaboration.  

[Clicknium Python Package](./api/python/pythonsdk.md): Clicknium python package provides programming interfaces to automate various types of applications, such as Web browser, Windows Desktop application, Java application and Sap windows Gui app, etc.

import subprocess
from time import sleep
from clicknium import clicknium as cc, locator, ui

def main():
    # sample code to demo web automation and desktop application
    tab = cc.edge.open("https://www.bing.com/")
    tab.find_element(
        locator.new_store.sample.bing.search_sb_form_q).set_text('clicknium')
    tab.find_element(locator.new_store.sample.bing.svg).click()
    sleep(3)
    tab.close()

    process = subprocess.Popen("notepad")
    ui(locator.new_store.sample.notepad.document_15).set_text("clicknium")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Install and enable browser extension
Click 'Clicknium Explorer' in Visual Studio Code Activity Bar.  
Show 'AUTOMATION EXTENSIONS' view in Visual Studio Code Side Bar.  
Choose the Edge browser and click the 'install' button.

- For more about Clicknium Recorder, refer [here](./developtools/recorder/recorder.md).  

## First line automation code
After capturing UI locators, write python script to automate the target UI element as below. 
- For any locator you captured, you can reference it in code by starting `locator.`, the following node will be listed in syntax popup for you to select and autofill.
```python
from clicknium import clicknium as cc, locator, ui
cc.find_element(locator.new_store.sample.targetele).click()
ui(locator.new_store.sample.targetele).click()
```
- For more about automation API, refer [Clicknium python package documents](./api/python/pythonsdk.md).   

## Run/Debug automation code
- Open related python file, run this script by `Ctrl+F5`.
- Open related python file, debug this script by `F5`.


## About Clicknium Project
With clicknium project, you can develop an automation solution in an isolated python virtual environment. The isolated environment guarantees the project behave indifferently in different developers' working environments. 
Clicknium provides following commands about project, you may view more [here](./developtools/project_management.md).  
- `Clicknium: Create Project` create a project.
- `Clicknium: Debug Project` debug the project.
- `Clicknium: Run Project` run the project.
- `Clicknium: Package Project` package the project to a standalone executable file.
