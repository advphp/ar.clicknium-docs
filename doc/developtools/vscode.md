## Extension Installation
[Automation Extensions](./doc/developtools/extensions/extensions.md)

## Record UI Locators
In Visual Studio Code, press `CTRL+F10` to invoke Clicknium recorder and minimize current Visual Studio Code window.

The capture technology indicates which automation technology currently used to capture UI elements. The supporting automation technology are as follows:
- UIA： Leverage Microsoft UI Automation, used for most windows application such as win32, winform, WPF application and so on
- IA: based on MSAA (Microsoft Active Accessibility)
- Java: automation for Java application, supporting JRE version above 1.6
- IE: automation for Internet Explorer, supporting version above 5.5 
- Chrome: automation for Chrome ,installation of chrome extension is need at first, supporting version above 60
- Edge: automation for Edge, installation of Edge extension is needed at first
- Firefox: automation for Firefox, installation of Firefox extension is needed at first, supporting version above 56
- SAP: automation for SAP WinGUI, SAP GUI Scripting setting is enabled at first 
  
Default is ***Auto Detect***, which means clicknium recorder automatically select the technology:  
If the mouse moves on Windows applicaiton, it will use UIA technology to locate the element;   
If the mouse moves on Java applicaiton, it will use Java technology to locate the element;   
If the mouse moves on Internet explorer, it will use IE technology to locate the element;   
If the mouse moves on Chrome, it will use Chrome technology to the locate element;   
If the mouse moves on Microsoft Edge, it will use Edge technology to locate the element;   
If themouse moves on Firefox, it will use Firefox technology to locate the element;   
If mouse moves on Sap windows GUI, it will use SAP technology to locate the element

Advanced Option: default is None, when you choose `XPath`, it will immediately affect on web automation technology (IE, Chrome, Edge, Firefox) while capturing the element, and generate locator in XPath style.

Cursor Position(X,Y): current mouse postion on the screen

After invoking Clicknium Recorder, it will highlight the element recognized by moving the mouse to the target application. 
If you want to capture the element, press `Ctrl` and click to add  the element locator.

- locator store: the file to store locator data. The locators of the same application are stored in one locator store by default. Users can manage the locator store in Visual Studio Code or Clicnium Recorder.
- locator: UI element locator, the string(XML fragment) that used to find the element including application information and all necessary parent nodes of the UI element, and  attributes of each element itself.
- Screenshot: While recording the elements, store the screenshot together with the locator
- Attributes: Users can select/deselect or edit the value of each attribute.

More about the locator, please refer to [clicknium locator](./doc/automation/locator.md)

After editing the locator, you can press button`Validate`, it will minimize Visual Studio Code and highlight the found element. If not found, it will show detailed errors.

## Writing code
- Auto Code Complete
Set the locator as the parameter, for example, `cc.find_element(`, you can press `Ctrl`+F10 to invoke Clicknium Recorder and capture the elements. Return to Visual Studio Code, the captured element will be automatically filled like `cc.find_element(locator.chrome.bing.search_sb_form_q)`

- IntelliSense
If you want to choose one locator in the locator store, Clicknium code extension can show you the locator store list and the locator list.
